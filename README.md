# Screenshot Pixel Ruler

Paste or upload a screenshot from your mobile device, choose your screen-size, then use the ruler to measure the size of features.

Use the arrow keys to move the rulers — when focussed on the `⤭` button.

Try ALT + arrow key to move in bigger increments!

## Can’t see your screen size?

If you can’t see your device and screen dimensions in the selector, then [visit this CodePen with your device][pen-ss], and let Nick know the device name and dimensions shown. He’ll update the tool.

## About

This tool is being developed to test for the new [Success Criterion 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum)][tsm] in the _DRAFT_ Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2 standard.

It is a work-in-progress! Feedback welcome!
